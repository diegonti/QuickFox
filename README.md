# Quick Fox: Play with Friends (Web App)

Quick Fox is a combination of question-answer games (Trivia, random questions, most probable to, etc) to play with friends. 

My friend group and I first created a simple version of the game with physical cards, but notice that if we wanted to add more questions we would have to create (and pay) for these new cards. That's when the idea came of doing a simple web app so that we could play and include as many questions as we wanted.

And since I'm the biggest nerd when it comes to programming, I was eager to delve a little deeper into the world of web development. So, I got to work to create a simple version of the game and, in the process, learn a bit more.

The web is developed in simple HTML/CSS and the communication and backend is managed with Flask (Python)
